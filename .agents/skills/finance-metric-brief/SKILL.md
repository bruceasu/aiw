description: Clarify the intended meaning, use, and unresolved conflicts of a financial metric before it becomes an implemented data contract or report specification. Use for metric discovery and reconciliation discussions, not for SQL, ETL, or OpenSpec writes.

# Finance Metric Brief

Produce a `Metric Brief` that captures the intended business meaning of a number and the decisions still required before it can become a durable metric specification.

## Use when

- A dashboard, report, KPI, risk indicator, or decision depends on a metric whose meaning or consistency is uncertain.
- Existing finance, risk, regulatory, or management definitions may disagree.

## Do not use when

- The user asks for SQL, ETL, a dashboard implementation, migration, or a permanent OpenSpec metric spec.
- The item is purely presentational and has no business or aggregation semantics.

## Inputs

- Metric name or business question.
- Consuming decision or surface.
- Business context: who acts on it and how.

## Produce

Return a Requirement Artifact with `Artifact Type: Metric Brief` and local status `DEFINED`, `PARTIAL`, or `CONFLICT`.

Capture intended definition, formula, unit, time semantics, refresh expectation, source candidates, financial correctness concerns, conflicting definitions, and required owners. It is an input to later specification, not the specification itself.

## Rules

- Monetary metrics require explicit treatment of currency, precision, rounding, timezone, cut-off, settlement/value date, and snapshot-versus-transaction semantics.
- Do not invent sources, owners, formulas, or regulatory rules.
- `DEFINED` means the discussion evidence is sufficient for promotion consideration; it does not create a durable data contract. After user confirmation, AIW Requirement Management may capture this artifact; this Skill must not invoke capture.
- Use `%%` for gaps and recommend one next discussion stage without invoking it.
