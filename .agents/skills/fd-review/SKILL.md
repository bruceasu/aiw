# FD Review

Read `skills/work-management.md` and the repository instructions. Use this
Skill when an FD is Pending Verification or the user explicitly requests an
independent review. The Reviewer must use a separate session from the Worker
that wrote the code. Do not implement new scope during review.

Read the FD, Issue evidence when present, relevant stable specs, the Worker's
implementation report, and the exact diff or commits under review. Check
correctness, acceptance coverage, compatibility, unexpected files, and the
truth of each reported verification result. Run no test or final build unless
the repository authorization rules permit it. An unrun check is not passed.
Use the FD's latest recorded human decisions when judging required evidence.
If a check was explicitly waived, assess the remaining behavior using the
available static or user-provided evidence and report the untested risk; do
not repeat an older review's demand for that check. A waiver of testing does
not waive an unmet behavior requirement. Name the exact current requirement
and missing evidence when requesting changes.
When taking a pending Reviewer handoff in a host session, first claim its
exact event with `aiw fd claim <id> <event-id> --session <host-session-id>`.
Use this Reviewer's host-provided ID if available; otherwise create a unique,
stable reference in this Reviewer session and use it consistently. The value
is an ownership label, so the human need not supply it. Never use the Worker's
reference. Check the latest receipt before claiming and do not take over an
event owned by another session. Include this Reviewer's reference in the report.

Write a concise review report to a project-relative file under
`docs/features/reviews/`. Include FD ID, source event ID, reviewed commit or
diff base, findings with file paths, commands actually run, skipped checks,
and residual risk. Keep the report separate from the Worker's report.
For an FD with `**Evidence policy:** Dual`, write the human report in Chinese
and a same-basename structured JSON sidecar with schema
`aiw.fd.evidence.v1`, kind `reviewer-report`, FD ID, source event, Markdown
filename, and structured findings/results. Put one `<!-- aiw-data: <same-basename-json-file> -->`
comment in Markdown and use the Markdown as `--artifact`.

For an FD with `**Test policy:** Independent`, inspect the current Tester
report, its scenario mapping and actual results, raw coverage evidence or
unavailable reason, the Planner authorization record for every executed
command, and PM's versioned Test Report Decision. Check the exact command,
FD revision/digest, Tester session, risk basis, and any human approval
reference against actual execution. Confirm the scenario inventory splits
broad acceptance items into distinct behaviors and does not count partial
coverage of an item as coverage of its untested behaviors. The Reviewer
session must differ from both Worker and Tester sessions. Respect a recorded
PM exception to the 70% coverage threshold; it does not turn failed or unrun
tests into passed evidence or waive an unmet behavior requirement.

If a material issue remains, emit `changes-requested` with `--producer
reviewer --artifact <report>` and `--source-event <id>` when the original
handoff was dispatched. This returns work to Worker. If all stated acceptance
conditions are supported by real evidence, emit `verification-passed` with the
same identity fields. Update the FD Verification section with the report path
and outcome. A passed review permits a later close decision; it does not
push, merge, release, deploy, or archive by itself.
