description: Explore technical feasibility, constraints, boundaries, and trade-offs for a financial requirement before an AIW Task or OpenSpec design exists. Use for solution options; not for implementation review, final design approval, or release readiness.

# Finance Engineering Options

Produce `Engineering Options` for a requirement: alternatives, constraints, dependencies, security and audit implications, and decisions a later design must make. This is not a review of implemented code and does not create `design.md`.

## Use when

- A clear problem and business intent need technical feasibility or trade-off analysis before promotion to engineering work.

## Do not use when

- The request is still feature-centred or lacks a decision flow; route to `finance-requirement-intake`.
- The user asks for code review, implementation, schema migration, Task creation, final OpenSpec design, or release approval.

## Inputs

- Problem Brief or Business Case.
- Target systems and known producers/consumers.
- Metric Brief when the capability surfaces financial metrics.

## Produce

Return a Requirement Artifact with `Artifact Type: Engineering Options` and local status `FEASIBLE`, `CONSTRAINED`, or `NEEDS_DECISION`.

Describe options rather than prescribing implementation. Cover boundaries, dependencies, candidate data flow, permission and audit concerns, material failure modes, observability needs, and decisions that must be resolved during formal design.

## Rules

- Do not write code, migrations, deployment plans, OpenSpec design files, or implementation tasks. After user confirmation, AIW Requirement Management may capture this artifact; this Skill must not invoke capture.
- Do not promise backward compatibility, permissions, audit retention, or data contracts without evidence.
- Do not produce release `GO`/`NO_GO` conclusions.
- Use `%%` for unknown contracts, owners, security requirements, and risks; recommend one next discussion stage without invoking it.
