# Numbered FD operations

The portable layout is `docs/features/TEMPLATE.md`,
`docs/features/FEATURE_INDEX.md`, `docs/features/FD-XXX_SLUG.md`, and
`docs/features/archive/`. The FD file owns status and numbered Work Items.
The index is rebuilt by `aiw fd` after stage changes. Do not create a second
status store or require a vendor-specific agent command.

## Create

Run `aiw fd new "title" [--issue ID]`. The command allocates the next number
across active and archived files, creates a Design FD from the template, and
records a Planner handoff. `--issue` requires an approved Issue record. Do not
invent an Issue ID or create an OpenSpec change unless requested.

## Explore and design

Read the FD, project guidance, relevant code, stable specs, and earlier FDs.
Compare meaningful options and record the chosen approach and reason. Use
`%% NEEDS_INPUT` for material gaps. Planner emits `design-ready` only after the
FD contains a solution, numbered Work Items, acceptance, and Verification.

`aiw fd list` shows the index and `aiw fd show FD-001` shows one FD and its
last handoff. If an event is pending, use the named role Skill or `aiw fd
resume`. If it is launching or dispatched, inspect the original process,
session, or log before trying to continue.

## Implement and review

Worker implements all ready items in order, updates the FD with real progress,
and emits `implementation-ready` with an implementation report. Independent
Reviewer emits `changes-requested` with findings or `verification-passed` with
its report. Pass `--source-event` when completing a dispatched handoff. A
business decision uses `needs-decision` and later `decision-recorded`.

Run only checks allowed by the repository. Local focused commits are allowed
under the project rules; commits do not authorize merge, push, or release.
Create a worktree with `aiw fd worktree add FD-001` only when isolation is
needed and the FD plan has been committed.

## Close

Use `aiw fd close FD-001 Complete` only after a passed review. Deferred and
Closed require `--reason "..."`. Close archives the file and updates the
index. It does not clean a worktree or deliver code. Update a project changelog
only when the repository uses one.
