# To Tickets

Break a plan, spec, or conversation into a set of **tickets** — tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring the tickets that **block** it.

Read `skills/work-management.md` and resolve one OpenSpec change before
writing. Do not create a parallel `.scratch` ticket hierarchy.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a
change identifier or spec path, resolve and read the corresponding OpenSpec
artifacts. A GitHub/GitLab URL is read only when the user explicitly asks for an
external projection.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Ticket titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Look for opportunities to prefactor the code to make the implementation easier. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the work into **tracer bullet** tickets.

<vertical-slice-rules>

- Each slice cuts a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests) — vertical, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Each slice is sized to fit in a single fresh context window
- Any prefactoring should be done first

</vertical-slice-rules>

Give each item an explicit order and acceptance criteria. Represent ordinary
dependencies through task order and wording in `tasks.md`; do not invent
external blocking links for work that shares one AIW task and worktree.

**Wide refactors are the exception to vertical slicing.** A **wide refactor** is one mechanical change — rename a column, retype a shared symbol — whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so a single edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. Don't force it into a tracer bullet; sequence it as **expand–contract**. First expand: add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks. Then migrate the call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), each batch its own ticket blocked by the expand, keeping CI green batch to batch because the old form still exists. Finally contract: delete the old form once no caller remains, in a ticket blocked by every migrate batch. When even the batches can't stay green alone, keep the sequence but let them share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket — green is promised only there.

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each ticket, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Order / prerequisites**: which earlier task items gate this one
- **What it delivers**: the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the prerequisites correct — does each item depend only on work that genuinely gates it?
- Should any tickets be merged or split further?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Write the approved task breakdown

Write the approved items as numbered checklist entries in the current change's
`tasks.md`, ordered by prerequisite. If a slice requires an independent
worktree, status, archive lifecycle, or delivery boundary, propose a separate
OpenSpec change instead of creating a local ticket file. External publication is
a separate explicit workflow.

<task-item-template>

# <NN> — <Ticket title>

**What to build:** the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective — not a layer-by-layer implementation list.

**Prerequisites:** earlier task numbers that gate this item, or "None — can start immediately".

- [ ] Acceptance criterion 1
- [ ] Acceptance criterion 2

</task-item-template>

<independent-change-template>

## Parent

A reference to the parent issue on the tracker (if the source was an existing issue, otherwise omit this section).

## What to build

The end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective — not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Prerequisites

- A reference to each blocking ticket, or "None — can start immediately".

In either form, avoid specific file paths or code snippets — they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.
